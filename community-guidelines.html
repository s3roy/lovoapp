      <p>
        Lovo is a platform dedicated to emotional wellness and safe social
        interactions. The app currently offers a free chat feature that allows
        users to connect and support each other in a positive and respectful
        environment. To maintain this supportive atmosphere, we ask all users to
        adhere to the following Community Guidelines alongside our Terms of Use.
      </p>
      <p>
        While using the app, please be kind and respectful to others, just as
        you would in a real-world interaction. Lovo is a community of people who
        come together to share experiences, seek support, and engage in
        uplifting conversations.
      </p>
      <p>
        We urge you to avoid any actions that could lead to harm, distress, or
        emotional discomfort. As part of our commitment to emotional safety, we
        enforce a strict No Nudity Policy, and any identifiable nudity will
        result in content removal or termination of your session.
      </p>
      <p>
        By following the guidelines below, we can ensure Lovo remains a platform
        where users can connect in a healthy, supportive way. Violations may
        result in account suspension, content removal, or other appropriate
        actions.
